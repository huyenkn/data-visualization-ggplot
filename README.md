# Data visualization with ggplot and ggnet

I used ggplot and ggnet (R) to create various types of charts with different ways of processing data and formatting charts. 

### Charts:
1. Scatterplots

2. Distributions
+ Histogram
+ Box plot

3. Categorical plots
+ Bar chart (horizontal and vertical bar charts)
+ Stacked bar chart
+ Clustered bar chart
+ Pyramid chart

4. Area charts
+ Area chart
+ Square area chart

3. Time series charts
+ Line chart
+ Waterfall chart

4. Network

### Data: 
1. Lending Club: The Lending Club data is LendingClub_LoanStats_2011_v2.csv. Lending Club is an online, peer-to-peer marketplace that connects borrowers and investors. I conducted some exploratory analysis on a dataset of past Lending Club loans, including loan details and information about the borrowers. Of particular interest are variables loan_amnt, which represents the amount of money requested by a borrower, and funded_amnt, which represents the amount of money actually
funded by investors. A full data dictionary can be found in LCDataDictionary.xlsx.

2. Dow Jones: The Dow Jones data is DowJones_history.csv. This contains the daily Open, Close, High and Low stock price for the Dow Jones industrial available index from late June through late Sept 2020. The data source is Yahoo!Finance.

3. Thurman networks: Blake Thurman analyzed the employees at an office to understand how the network structure influenced power dynamics and success. There are two files: Thurman social networks and Thurman reporting structure. The social relationship data describes the informal relationship among the employees and the office data describes the reporting hierarchy. The paper is: In the office: Networks and coalitions.
